This repository contains data relevant to an experiment conducted in 2019 in an ongoing nitrogen-by-sulfur field manipulation experiment around Ithaca, NY. This repository and associated data corresponds with a manuscript currently in preparation, preliminarily titled *"Soil nitrogen availability modifies leaf water and nitrogen economies in a closed canopy temperate forest: a direct test of photosynthetic least-cost theory"*.

This repository is currently under construction and will be published on Zenodo once complete.
