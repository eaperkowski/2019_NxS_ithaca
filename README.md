# 2019_NxS_ithaca
This repository contains data relevant to an experiment conducted in 2019 in an ongoing nitrogen-by-sulfur field manipulation experiment around Ithaca, NY. This repository and associated data corresponds with the manuscript titled "Soil nitrogen availability modifies leaf nitrogen economies in mature temperate deciduous forests: a direct test of photosynthetic least-cost theory". Manuscript is currently in review.

The repository is structured into three main folders: "data", "scripts", and "raw_licor_files":

  - `data`: contains the compiled datasheet used for the manuscript (`2019_NxS_datasheet.csv`) and the metadata file for the compiled datasheet (`2019_NxS_datasheet_meta.csv`).
  
  - `scripts`: contains R scripts for all data analysis. Includes all analyses for both the main manuscript (`2019_NxS_analyses.R`) and the supplemental information (`2019_NxS_supp_analyses.R`).
  
  - `raw_licor_files`: unedited .csv files exported from LI-6800. All column heading metadata can be found on the LI-COR website.
